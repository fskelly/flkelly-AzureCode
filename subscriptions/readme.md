# Azure Audit / Inventory Script

Original credit for Inventory script goes to <http://contoso.se/blog/?p=4286,> I have simply changed it to meet my needs. I have broken the script down into a few components so that you can use the script as you need to.

The combined sript is naturally all the funcionality built in and the other cmponents are numbered so that you can use individual pieces.
