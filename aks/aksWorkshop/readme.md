There is an amazong lab at https://aksworkshop.io/, this is NOT a replacement of that at all, this is an augementation of that workshop. Credit were credit is due.

This is an "off-shoot" of https://aksworkshop.io/. I have simply tried to make the commands a little easier to follow, by creating a folder structure and shell type commands to run with the use of variables.

In order to use this, please populate the variables as needed.
