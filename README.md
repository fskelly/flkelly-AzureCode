I am currently a **Microsoft Employee**, this is just my personal repository of Azure Code. this code ranges from
[az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest), [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/overview?view=azps-1.4.0), [python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/azure/?view=azure-python), some [azbb](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki), some [Terrafrom](https://www.terraform.io) and [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/) calls. This collection will grow over time and if you are not seeing it yet, it simply means I am testing, I try to get the code/samples as accurate as possible. </br>
