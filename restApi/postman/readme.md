# Getting started

Please note that I use Postman [Environments](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments/) for the variables, in my case **"{{tenantId-flkelly}}"** in my queries

The first step is to "authenicate" against Azure AD to allow you to make changes. the steps can be found [here](gettingStarted/access_token.png)
